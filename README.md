# Towards Robust, Locally Linear Deep Networks:

This repository is for the paper

 * "[Towards Robust, Locally Linear Deep Networks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SylCrnCcFX)" by [Guang-He Lee](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guanghe/), [David Alvarez Melis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/davidam/), and [Tommi S. Jaakkola](http://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/) in ICLR 19.
 * [Project page](http://people.csail.mit.edu/guanghe/locally_linear)

## Package version:

 * PyTorch0.4.1
 * python3.6.1

## Reproducing the MNIST experiment:

 * Please execute the shell files (`gamma100_fc.sh`) to reproduce the experiment on MNIST dataset with gamma=100. The results will be in the folder `fc_log/`

 * `parse_log.py` is a utility script. After you run all the models using `gamma100_fc.sh`. Use the following comment:

   * `ls fc_log > fc_log.list`
   * `cd fc_log`
   * `python ../parse_log.py --file-list ../fc_log.list`

 * To inspect the best model in terms of the median of L2 margin given each validation accuracy, please look into the log file to see the testing scores of the model.

## Other experiments:

 * Unfortunately we don't plan to release the codes for other experiments.
